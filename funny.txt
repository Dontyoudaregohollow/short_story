This file will contain a short silly funny story.

The sun will come down tomorrow I think, it won't rise like it usually does but it will fall. Plummeting down below the horizon and plunging the world into an unescapable darkness that will bathe us all in its terrible blackness. We will be lost in the endless night and without hope, without remorse, humanity will die alone in the cold.
Monday's am I right?
